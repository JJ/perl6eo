	* xover-string.p6: Testing with strings. Looks a bit faster, still slower than most.

	* onemax-hyper.p6: Changes to race.

	* onemax-Int.p6: Adds int array, which is way much slower than Bool for some reason.

	* onemax-hyper.p6: Testing with parallel evaluation, results are not too good. Even with batch size reset. Simply not worth the while for small arrays.
