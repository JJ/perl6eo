	* royal-road-race.p6: Same, but using implicitly parallel race.
	Put the race at the beginning.
	Let's try to have the parallel version kick in only when it's needed. And reduce by 10 the number of iterations.

	* royal-road.p6: Teste royal road for Perl 6 and comparing it with Perl.

	* xover-string.p6: Testing with strings. Looks a bit faster, still slower than most.

	* onemax-hyper.p6: Changes to race.

	* onemax-Int.p6: Adds int array, which is way much slower than Bool for some reason.

	* onemax-hyper.p6: Testing with parallel evaluation, results are not too good. Even with batch size reset. Simply not worth the while for small arrays.
